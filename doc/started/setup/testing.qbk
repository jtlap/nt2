[section Testing __NT2__]

__NT2__ provides a large array of tests covering all its functionalities.
Once built, those tests can be run locally by using CTest either globally or by using
CTest finer-grain test selection using regular expressions to select a module or
a single function to test.

[heading Test Types]
__NT2__ provides three types of tests:

* Unit Tests: assert the correctness of both compilation and execution
of __NT2__ features.
* Cover Tests: tests precision on a random sampling for numerical
algorithms. Those tests help maintaining a high level of numerical precision.
* Exhaustive Tests: perform an exhaustive exploration of the whole value space to assess numerical correctness.
Those tests are only provided for single precision floating-point due to time constraints. Their output is an histogram of precision by input range.

[heading Configuration]

Due to __NT2__ having many tests, and thefore many targets, the behaviour of how targets are added to the build system is
configurable when configuring the __CMAKE__ project.

* =NT2_WITH_TESTS_FULL=: one target per test, but causes problems with generators that do not scale well. Default for __NINJA__.
* =NT2_WITH_TESTS=: one target per test suite. Default for Makefile generators (GNU Make, NMake).
* None of the above: no test targets at all. Default for IDEs such as MSVC.

Additionally, the following configuration variables are available:

* =NT2_WITH_TESTS_COVER=: enables cover tests. Not enabled by default.
* =NT2_WITh_TESTS_EXHAUSTIVE=: enables exhaustive tests. Not enabled by default.
* =NT2_WITH_TESTS_BENCH=: makes benchmarks behave the same as tests. Not enabled by default. Benchmarks are otherwise always enabled whenever unit tests are.

When configuring __NT2__ with __CMAKE__, it is also possible to specify which set of flags to use when compiling the
tests. The __CMAKE__ variable =CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_NT2TEST= may be redefined in the cache to override the default.

The default is to compile with moderate a optimization level, with a fairly exhaustive list of warnings and
with assertions enabled and set to trigger exceptions. The =NT2_EXTRA_WARNINGS= option can be used to enable even more warnings.
Due to bugs in GCC, strict aliasing support is explicitly disabled for that compiler.

[heading Building]

Test naming is done with the following layout:

[pre
[^module].[^sub-module].[^test-suite].[^sub-test-suite].[^test-type]
]

for example, assuming =NT2_WITH_TESTS_FULL= is defined, the =compare_less= unit test in the =scalar= test suite in the =boost.simd.operator= module is named

``
boost.simd.operator.scalar.compare_less.unit
``

The whole =scalar= test suite (which only requires =NT2_WITH_TESTS=) can be built with

``
boost.simd.operator.scalar.unit
``

and it's also possible to compile many tests at the same time by going up this scheme (=boost.simd.operator.unit=, =boost.simd.unit=, =boost.unit=, =unit=).

[heading Performance Concerns]

__NT2__ uses C++ programming techniques which can require significant resources to compile tests. Compiling a test may require up to 4GB of RAM,
in particular for the tests of the =core= module, though most tests run well below 2GB. This can limit parallelization opportunities depending on how much RAM is available.

Compiling the full set of unit and cover tests takes 2 hours on bi-xeon quadcore server using 4 threads.


[heading Reporting]

The results of __NT2__ tests may be uploaded to [@http://cdash.lri.fr/index.php?project=NT2 a remote CDash server] for easy monitoring and tracking.

The easiest way to achieve this is to run `ctest -D Experimental` after having built all tests with `make unit`.
This approach however only reports the results of the tests at runtime, and not updating, configuring, or building errors.

Another approach is to use a CTest script to do all steps and report them to CDash:

``
set(CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY "path/to/the/source")
set(CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY "path/to/build/directory")

# Uncomment to override the name used to identify the machine.
# Defaults to machine hostname.
#set(CTEST_SITE "my_computer_name")

# Uncomment to override the name used to identify the build.
# Defaults to auto-detected setup. Can be wrong when building for 32-bit on 64-bit system and vice versa
#set(CTEST_BUILD_NAME "my_configuration_name")

set(CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR "Unix Makefiles") # or Ninja, or NMake Makefiles, etc.
set(CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND "make -k -j4 unit") # adapt accordingly

#######################################################################

find_program(CTEST_GIT_COMMAND NAMES git)
set(CTEST_UPDATE_COMMAND ${CTEST_GIT_COMMAND})

ctest_start("Experimental")
ctest_update()
ctest_configure()
ctest_build()
ctest_test()
ctest_submit()
``

The following script may then be invoked with `ctest -S name_of_file.cmake`. If you intend to run such a script on a regular basis (such as through a cron job
or Windows scheduled task), you may change ="Experimental"= to ="Nightly"=.
