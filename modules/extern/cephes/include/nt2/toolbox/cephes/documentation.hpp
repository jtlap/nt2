 *
 * \brief This toolbox provides wrappers to a selection of cephes C functions 
 * for testing purpose or high-accuracy needs.
 *
 * The cephes library (http://www.netlib.org/cephes/) is a collection of more 
 * than 400 high quality mathematical routines for scientific and engineering 
 * applications. All are written entirely in C language. In addition to the 
 * elementary arithmetic and transcendental routines, the library includes a 
 * substantial collection of probability integrals, Bessel functions, and higher
 * transcendental functions. Each function subroutine has been tested by comparing 
 * at a large number of points against high precision check routines using 144 
 * bits (43 decimal) precision. 
 *
 * Note that many of these functions are available in other \nt2 toolboxes with 
 * better performances and should be preferred unless specific precision problems 
 * has to be handled.
